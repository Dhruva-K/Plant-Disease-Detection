       name: "Esca",
       symptoms: "Symptom appears on leaves, trunk, canes and berries. On leaves we will see intervenaial striping looks like tiger strips. White cultivars shows chlorotic and necrotic strips where as red cultivars shows red areas and necrotic strips. On berries we will see superficial spots and later may coalesce making berries appear black. Trunk/arm/cordons shows dark brown black vascular streaking and oozes dark sap when we cut trunk. Some time this measles in associate with numerous secondary wood rotting fungi which decorate the vineyard completely.",
       observations:  "The leaf and berry symptoms may occur together in single cane or may show symptom on only one parts. The severe infestation of measles kill grapevine in a single year which is commonly called apoplexy. The symptoms are common in 5 to 7 year old vineyard. The prune wounds helps in pathogen entrance and establishment.",
       measures: "Till date there is no effective method to control this disease. Remove the infected berries, leaves and trunk and destroy them. Protect the prune wounds to minimize fungal infection using wound sealant (5% boric acid in acrylic paint) or essential oil or suitable fungicides.Raisins affected by measles will be discarded during harvest or at the packing house, while table grape growers will leave affected fruit on the vine."

        name: "Leaf Blight",
        symptoms: "On leaf surface we will see lesions which are irregularly shaped (2 to 25 mm in diameter). Initially lesions are dull red to brown in color turn black later. If disease is severe this lesions may coalesce. On berries we can see symptom similar to black rot but the entire clusters will collapse.Leaf spots sometimes develop a target-like pattern of rings.Severely infected leaves turn brown, curl upward, wither and die.Fruit can suffer from sunscald due to leaf loss.",
        observations:  "Common in tropical and subtropical grapes. The disease appear late in the season. Cynthiana and Cabernet Sauvignon are susceptible to this pathogen.Wind currents can carry Alternaria cucumerina a long distance.Alternaria cucumerina can also spread within the field by splashing water.Wet, rainy weather favors diseases. Damage can be very severe in warm, wet conditions.",
        measures: "Fungicides sprayed for other diseases in the season may help to reduce this disease.Several fungicides are available for use against Alternaria leaf blight. Preventative sprays are effective but are only necessary in fields with a history of Alternaria leaf blight.Daconil® Fungicide Ready-to-Use is ideal for small garden areas, container gardens, and individual plants in edible landscapes.

        name: "Black Rot",
        symptoms: "Brown lesions on the leaves that develop black dots (pycnidia); grapes have light spots that eventually form pycnidia; grapes harden and turn black, while still remaining on the vineThe earliest, most recognizable indicator of black rot infections are the leaf lesions. These appear as circular, tan lesions that have a darker margin.The ideal conditions for black rot infection are temperatures between 70°F to 80°F, when it takes only six to seven hours of leaf wetness for infection to occur.",
        observations:  "Disease favors rainy weather; spores may ooze out during rain.The amount of overwintering inoculum and the current season's weather conditions are the key factors affecting the level of black rot found in a vineyard.No infection by black rot occurs when temperatures are below 45°F. At 50°F it takes 24 hours of leaf wetness to provide the conditions necessary for a black rot spore to germinate and infect the green tissue of grapes.",
        measures: "Remove all mummified fruit from vines during dormant pruning; cultivate soil during bud break to bury mummies and reduce inoculant; application of appropriate fungicides can help control the disease.Sanitation plays a huge part in limiting the amount of black rot inoculum found in a vineyard. Removal of infected canes through pruning during the dormant season will reduce the level of overwintering inoculum."

        name: "Healthy",
        symptoms: "Your vines are healthy however taking necessary precautions is always beneficial.The fertilizer requirements of bunch grapes can vary widely depending upon vine vigor and crop size.If fertilizing is necessary, apply a small amount of 10-10-10 fertilizer two to three weeks after planting, keeping it one foot away from the vine's base.Handle the grapes as little as possible to avoid rubbing off the powdery gray blush on the fruit for a longer storage life.",
