# VineDoc
## Motive
Grape cultivation plays a crucial role in the economy of Maharashtra, but unforeseen diseases pose a threat to the vineyards and inevitably to the livelihood of farmers. Farmers are unable to identify the diseases manually and by the time expert advice is sought, the damage has already been done. 
Moreover, just detection of the disease may not be helpful for a farmer because he/she might completely be unaware of the measures to be taken.


## Solution
VineDoc is a React Native app that predicts diseases contracted by grapevines. The images clicked in this app are given as input to the back-end CNN model that predicts the condition of grape leaves with 98% accuracy. 
The app also has a fertilizer calculator to aid farmers in deciding the precise quantity of fertilizers to be applied per vine.
